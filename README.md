# Pokemon-Yellow-and-Red
This is an educational project that we did while learning PyGame. It's a simple board game about catching Pokemons. <br>
The game process is mainly the character walking around the field finding either a new pokemon, a bonus or a trap. <br>
The goal is to catch all pokemons, you can catch a pokemon by defeating it in battle. <br>
We've incorporated commonly used stats like ATK, CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG into the battle mechanics for a possibility of further development.
# Have fun with the game!
